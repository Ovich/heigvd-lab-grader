name: grader/criteria
description: >
  Generate or update the grading criteria table for a lab. On first run,
  analyses student submissions, solution diff, lab spec, and course material
  to propose a criteria breakdown. On re-run, shows current criteria and
  guides the professor through changes, handling scoring table archiving and
  re-grading tracking automatically. Always invokes grader/procedure when done.

# grader/criteria

## Guiding Principles

**Never modify this skill file.** All session-specific decisions belong in
MIND.md or `criteria-work.md`.

**Output goes to central MIND.md.** Use `labs/<lab-slug>/criteria-work.md`
as a scratch pad for intermediate analysis only. The final confirmed criteria
table belongs in MIND.md `## Grading Criteria`.

**Always invoke `grader/procedure` after criteria are confirmed.** The
grading procedure is a downstream product of criteria — generate or
regenerate it whenever criteria change.

---

## Step 0 — Prerequisites and status check

### 0a — Verify init prerequisites

Scan for `labs/*/MIND.md`. If not found:
> Init has not been run yet. Please run `grader/init` first.

Read MIND.md. Verify each of the following — report any that are unmet and stop:

| Requirement | Check |
|-------------|-------|
| MIND.md exists | Found at `labs/<lab-slug>/MIND.md` |
| Submissions cloned | Scoring Table has at least one row |
| Lab spec present | `labs/<lab-slug>/lab-spec.md` exists |

### 0b — Check current criteria status

Read `## Grading Criteria` in MIND.md.

- **Empty / placeholder** → first run. Proceed to Step 1.
- **Already populated** → re-run. Jump to the **Re-run flow** section below.

---

## Step 1 — Gather resources (first run)

Store all intermediate analysis in `labs/<lab-slug>/criteria-work.md`.

### 1a — Solution diff

Check `## Solution Diff` in MIND.md.
- Already present → use it.
- Not present but solution ref is set in the MIND.md header → generate it:

```bash
cd _global/lab-solutions/<lab-slug>
git diff <template-branch>..<solution-branch> -- <relevant dirs>
```

Write result to `## Solution Diff` in MIND.md. Tick `Solution diff generated`.

- No solution ref → note the absence and continue.

### 1b — Sample student submissions

Select 2–3 submissions to analyse. Aim for variety:
- One with the most commits or largest diff (likely complete)
- One mid-range
- One with minimal changes (likely weak or partial)

For each, compute the diff that represents student work:

**Template-based lab** (students started from a provided template):
```bash
# find the first student commit (exclude bot commits)
BASE=$(git -C labs/<lab-slug>/submissions/<group-slug> log \
  --oneline --all --reverse \
  | grep -v "github-classroom\[bot\]" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
git -C labs/<lab-slug>/submissions/<group-slug> diff $BASE HEAD
```

**Free-form lab** (no template — students started from scratch):
```bash
BASE=$(git -C labs/<lab-slug>/submissions/<group-slug> \
  rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)
git -C labs/<lab-slug>/submissions/<group-slug> diff $BASE HEAD
```

Save each diff under a labelled section in `criteria-work.md`.

### 1c — Course material (optional)

Check whether `_global/course-material/` is present.

- **Present** → search for pages related to the lab topic (match lab name,
  slug, or key terms from lab-spec.md). Extract the relevant sections and
  append to `criteria-work.md`.
- **Absent** → inform the professor:
  > No course material was found. Adding it to `_global/course-material/`
  > would help generate more accurate criteria and grading procedures.
  > This is optional — I can continue without it.

### 1d — Lab spec

Re-read `labs/<lab-slug>/lab-spec.md`. Look for:
- Explicit grading sections or point breakdowns
- Lists of expected deliverables or features
- Technical constraints or prohibited patterns

Append findings to `criteria-work.md`.

---

## Step 2 — Analyse and propose criteria

Using everything in `criteria-work.md`, draft a criteria proposal:

- Each criterion maps to a concrete, gradable deliverable.
- Distinguish `automated` (test suite) from `manual` (code review / visual).
- Infer max points from any breakdown in the lab spec; otherwise propose
  relative weights.
- Note confidence: `explicit from spec` vs `inferred`.

Present the proposal to the professor in two explicit confirmation blocks:

**Block 1 — Criteria and grade formula:**
```
Proposed grading criteria for <lab-name>:

  Criterion              Max   Source
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  CriterionA              8    automated (test suite)
  CriterionB              4    manual
  ...
  Total                  /25

  Grade formula: round((points / 25 × 5) + 1 − penalties, 0.1)

  Source: inferred from lab-spec.md + submission analysis
  Low confidence: [anything uncertain — e.g. "no point breakdown in spec"]

Does this look right? Any changes before I proceed?
```

**Block 2 — Late penalty formula:**
```
Late penalty proposal:

  Default: −0.1 per started late day
  (Any fraction of a 24 h period past the deadline counts as one day —
   e.g. 1 h late = 1 day = −0.1; 25 h late = 2 days = −0.2)

  Source: <"stated in lab-spec.md" / "course default — not in spec">

  Is this formula correct?
  If different, please provide:
    • Deduction per day (e.g. −0.1, −0.5 …)
    • How partial days are counted (started day / full day / hours)
    • Any grace period or extension policy
```

Wait for explicit confirmation on both blocks before writing to MIND.md.

---

## Step 3 — Write to MIND.md and invoke procedure

Once confirmed:
1. Write the criteria table to `## Grading Criteria` in MIND.md.
2. Update the Scoring Table header with criterion columns.
3. Tick `Grading criteria defined` in the Phase 1 checklist.
4. Invoke `grader/procedure` to generate the grading procedure.

---

## Re-run flow — criteria already exist

### R1 — Show current state

Present a compact summary:
```
Current criteria for <lab-name>:
  CriterionA   8 pts   automated
  CriterionB   4 pts   manual
  ...
  Total: /25   Grade: (pts/25 × 5) + 1 − penalties

Grading progress: N / M groups graded
```

Ask the professor:
> What would you like to change?

### R2 — Classify the change

| Change type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Points-only** | "CriterionA from 8 to 10", "reduce CriterionB to 3" |
| **Criterion added or removed** | "Add error handling criterion", "Drop live testing" |
| **Both** | Mix of the above |

### R3a — Points-only change

1. Update the criteria table in MIND.md.
2. Offer to recalculate all existing scores using the new weights and update
   the Scoring Table accordingly.
3. Invoke `grader/procedure` to regenerate affected procedure subsections.

### R3b — Criterion added or removed (grading in progress)

1. **Archive** the current Scoring Table by renaming its heading:
   `## Scoring Table` → `## Scoring Table [archived — superseded <YYYY-MM-DD>]`

2. **Create** a new `## Scoring Table` with the updated criterion columns.

3. **Add** a `## Re-grading Tracker` section to MIND.md:

```markdown
## Re-grading Tracker
<!-- Groups that must be re-graded after criteria change on <YYYY-MM-DD>.  -->
<!-- grader/grade: check this table before grading — redo listed groups.   -->

| Group | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| <group-slug> | ⏳ needs re-grading | criterion added: <name> |
```

4. Populate the tracker with every group that had already been graded.

5. Update the criteria table in MIND.md.

6. Invoke `grader/procedure` to regenerate the full procedure.

Report clearly what changed and what the professor needs to do next.
