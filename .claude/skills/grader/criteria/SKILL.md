name: grader/criteria
description: >
  Generate or update the grading criteria table for a lab. On first run,
  analyses student submissions, solution diff, lab spec, and course material
  to propose a criteria breakdown. On re-run, shows current criteria and
  guides the professor through changes, handling scoring table archiving and
  re-grading tracking automatically. Always invokes grader/procedure when done.

# grader/criteria

## Guiding Principles

**Never modify this skill file.** All session-specific decisions belong in
MIND.md or `_mem/criteria-work.md`.

**Output goes to central MIND.md.** Use `labs/<lab-slug>/_mem/criteria-work.md`
as a scratch pad for intermediate analysis only. The final confirmed criteria
table belongs in MIND.md `## Grading Criteria`.

**Always invoke `grader/procedure` after criteria are confirmed.** The
grading procedure is a downstream product of criteria — generate or
regenerate it whenever criteria change.

**In free labs, criteria must be abstract.** When `**Nature:** free` is set
in MIND.md, every criterion must apply to any kind of project — e.g.
"Functionality", "Code quality", "Documentation". Never write
implementation-specific criteria (function names, test counts, specific APIs).
The grading procedure will interpret each abstract criterion per group during
grading.

---

## Criterion source types

Every criterion — including opt-ins — must be assigned one or more source
types. These types determine how grader/grade evaluates the criterion and
what the grading procedure must describe.

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **automated** | A tool runs (e.g. test suite, git log command) and the score is derived directly from its output. No AI judgment needed. |
| **manual** | AI analyses deliverables (code, config files, git history, manifests) and makes a judgment call. No project needs to run. |
| **live** | Runtime checks are required: the project is started (optionally by the agent) and the professor performs interactions and reports findings. |

**Combinations are valid.** A criterion can be `manual + live` when AI
analyses the code *and* the professor verifies behaviour at runtime. In that
case the grading procedure must describe both the static analysis and the
runtime checks.

Opt-ins are ordinary criteria with a predefined scope — they carry source
types like any other criterion.

---

## Step 0 — Prerequisites and status check

### 0a — Verify init prerequisites

Scan for `labs/*/MIND.md`. If not found:
> Init has not been run yet. Please run `grader/init` first.

Read MIND.md. Verify each of the following — report any that are unmet and stop:

| Requirement | Check |
|-------------|-------|
| MIND.md exists | Found at `labs/<lab-slug>/MIND.md` |
| Submissions cloned | Scoring Table has at least one row |
| Lab spec present | `labs/<lab-slug>/lab-spec.md` exists |

### 0b — Check current criteria status

Read `## Grading Criteria` in MIND.md.

- **Empty / placeholder** → first run. Proceed to Step 1.
- **Already populated** → re-run. Jump to the **Re-run flow** section below.

---

## Step 1 — Gather resources (first run)

Store all intermediate analysis in `labs/<lab-slug>/_mem/criteria-work.md`.

### 1a — Solution diff

Check `## Solution Diff` in MIND.md.
- Already present → use it.
- Not present but solution ref is set in the MIND.md header → generate it:

```bash
cd _global/lab-solutions/<lab-slug>
git diff <template-branch>..<solution-branch> -- <relevant dirs>
```

Write result to `## Solution Diff` in MIND.md. Tick `Solution diff generated`.

- No solution ref → note the absence and continue.

### 1b — Sample student submissions

Select 2–3 submissions to analyse. Aim for variety:
- One with the most commits or largest diff (likely complete)
- One mid-range
- One with minimal changes (likely weak or partial)

For each, compute the diff that represents student work:

**Template-based lab** (students started from a provided template):
```bash
# find the first student commit (exclude bot commits)
BASE=$(git -C labs/<lab-slug>/submissions/<group-slug> log \
  --oneline --all --reverse \
  | grep -v "github-classroom\[bot\]" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
git -C labs/<lab-slug>/submissions/<group-slug> diff $BASE HEAD
```

**Free-form lab** (no template — students started from scratch):
```bash
BASE=$(git -C labs/<lab-slug>/submissions/<group-slug> \
  rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)
git -C labs/<lab-slug>/submissions/<group-slug> diff $BASE HEAD
```

Save each diff under a labelled section in `_mem/criteria-work.md`.

### 1c — Course material (optional)

Check whether `_global/course-material/` is present.

- **Present** → search for pages related to the lab topic (match lab name,
  slug, or key terms from lab-spec.md). Extract the relevant sections and
  append to `_mem/criteria-work.md`.
- **Absent** → inform the professor:
  > No course material was found. Adding it to `_global/course-material/`
  > would help generate more accurate criteria and grading procedures.
  > This is optional — I can continue without it.

### 1d — Lab spec

Re-read `labs/<lab-slug>/lab-spec.md`. Look for:
- Explicit grading sections or point breakdowns
- Lists of expected deliverables or features
- Technical constraints or prohibited patterns

Append findings to `_mem/criteria-work.md`.

### 1e — Standard opt-ins

Standard opt-ins are reusable criteria blocks that apply across many labs.
They are opt-in — always ask the professor before including any.

Present the available opt-ins and ask which to include.
Omit [A] entirely if `**Nature:** free` or if no starter test suite exists.

```
Standard criteria opt-ins available:

  [A] Automated tests — visible                        [type: automated]
      Runs the starter test suite. Students know these tests.
      Scoring: 1 pt per passing test (proposed; professor can adjust).
      Cost: fast — seconds per group, minimal tokens.
      Include? If yes: confirm or adjust the 1 pt/test weight.

  [B] Automated tests — hidden coverage                [type: automated]
      After analysing each group's code, grader/grade will propose
      edge-case and untested-feature scenarios, generate tests, run them,
      and map failures to deductions on existing criteria.
      Required tooling is checked and proposed for installation per group
      during grading — nothing needs to be set up now.
      Cost: 1–3 min per group, significant token use (reads full student
      diff, generates test code, runs and interprets results).
      For a typical lab with 14 groups: ~20–40 min of extra grading time.
      Include? (yes / no)

  [C] Git & workflow practices                         [type: manual]
      AI analyses git history to evaluate how the student(s) worked.
      The exact depth is defined with the professor (see Notes below).
      Suggested: 2–5 pts depending on lab weight.
      Include? If yes: how many points?

Which opt-ins do you want to include, and with how many points each?
(Answer "none" to skip all, or name specific ones with their point value)
```

Notes:
- **Automated tests — visible [A]** are proposed only if **both** conditions hold:
  (1) `**Nature:** guided` — free labs have no shared starter, so [A] never applies;
  (2) a test suite is present in the **starter code** (the template branch of the solution ref,
  or the initial commit of any submission before student changes). Tests added by students
  do not count. Do not propose if either condition is unmet.
  Count the starter tests to anchor the 1 pt/test proposal.
- **Automated tests — hidden [B]** is independent of [A]. Tooling is
  detected and proposed per group during grading — not during init.
- If the professor enables hidden test coverage, record it in the
  `## Grading Criteria` section of MIND.md as a note under the automated
  tests criterion:
  `> Hidden test coverage: enabled — grader/grade will generate per-group tests`
- **Git & workflow practices [C]** is proposed for all labs — individual
  and group alike. Before writing the criterion, brainstorm its depth with
  the professor. Start by detecting whether the lab is individual or group
  (check distinct commit authors across a few submissions), then propose
  a depth appropriate to the context:

  *Single-student baseline (always relevant):*
  - Commit history exists and is meaningful (not a single dump)
  - Work spread over time, not all committed in the last hours before deadline
  - Commit messages are descriptive

  *Multi-student additions (when multiple authors detected):*
  - Balanced contribution across team members
  - Use of branches and pull requests
  - DevOps practices: CI, protected branches, PR reviews — include only
    what was taught in the course

  Present the proposed depth to the professor as a short checklist and
  ask which signals to include and how to weight them. Do not finalise
  this criterion until the professor confirms the depth.

Save the professor's opt-in choices to `_mem/criteria-work.md` before proceeding.

---

## Step 2 — Analyse and propose criteria

Using everything in `_mem/criteria-work.md`, draft a full criteria proposal
combining lab-specific criteria and any selected opt-ins.

**Weighting guidance:**
- If the lab spec states explicit point values, use them exactly.
- If not, propose weights based on relative importance: complexity of the
  implementation (inferred from solution diff size and submission variation),
  emphasis in the lab spec, and whether the criterion is automated or manual.
  Show your reasoning briefly next to each proposed value so the professor
  can adjust it.
- Mark each value as `explicit` (from spec) or `proposed` (your estimate).

- Each criterion maps to a concrete, gradable deliverable.
- Distinguish `automated` (test suite), `manual` (code review / visual),
  `opt-in` (standard block).
- Note confidence: `explicit from spec` vs `proposed`.

Present the proposal to the professor in two explicit confirmation blocks:

**Block 1 — Criteria and grade formula:**
```
Proposed grading criteria for <lab-name>:

  Criterion              Max   Type              Weight basis
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  CriterionA              8    automated         explicit from spec
  CriterionB              4    manual            proposed — largest diff section
  CriterionC              5    manual + live     proposed — code + runtime check
  Git & workflow          3    manual            proposed — confirmed depth with professor
  ...
  Total                  /25

  Grade formula: round((points / 25 × 5) + 1 − penalties, 0.1)

Does this look right? Adjust any points or add/remove criteria before I proceed.
```

**Block 2 — Late penalty formula:**
```
Late penalty proposal:

  Default: −0.1 per started late day
  (Any fraction of a 24 h period past the deadline counts as one day —
   e.g. 1 h late = 1 day = −0.1; 25 h late = 2 days = −0.2)

  Source: <"stated in lab-spec.md" / "course default — not in spec">

  Is this formula correct?
  If different, please provide:
    • Deduction per day (e.g. −0.1, −0.5 …)
    • How partial days are counted (started day / full day / hours)
    • Any grace period or extension policy
```

Wait for explicit confirmation on both blocks before writing to MIND.md.

---

## Step 3 — Write to MIND.md and invoke procedure

Once confirmed:
1. Write the criteria table to `## Grading Criteria` in MIND.md.
2. Update the Scoring Table header with criterion columns.
3. Tick `Grading criteria defined` in the Phase 1 checklist.
4. Invoke `grader/procedure` to generate the grading procedure.

---

## Re-run flow — criteria already exist

### R1 — Show current state

Present a compact summary:
```
Current criteria for <lab-name>:
  CriterionA   8 pts   automated
  CriterionB   4 pts   manual
  ...
  Total: /25   Grade: (pts/25 × 5) + 1 − penalties

Grading progress: N / M groups graded
```

Ask the professor:
> What would you like to change?

### R2 — Classify the change

| Change type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Points-only** | "CriterionA from 8 to 10", "reduce CriterionB to 3" |
| **Criterion added or removed** | "Add error handling criterion", "Drop live testing" |
| **Both** | Mix of the above |

### R3a — Points-only change

1. Update the criteria table in MIND.md.
2. Offer to recalculate all existing scores using the new weights and update
   the Scoring Table accordingly.
3. Invoke `grader/procedure` to regenerate affected procedure subsections.

### R3b — Criterion added or removed (grading in progress)

1. **Archive** the current Scoring Table by renaming its heading:
   `## Scoring Table` → `## Scoring Table [archived — superseded <YYYY-MM-DD>]`

2. **Create** a new `## Scoring Table` with the updated criterion columns.

3. **Add** a `## Re-grading Tracker` section to MIND.md:

```markdown
## Re-grading Tracker
<!-- Groups that must be re-graded after criteria change on <YYYY-MM-DD>.  -->
<!-- grader/grade: check this table before grading — redo listed groups.   -->

| Group | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| <group-slug> | ⏳ needs re-grading | criterion added: <name> |
```

4. Populate the tracker with every group that had already been graded.

5. Update the criteria table in MIND.md.

6. Invoke `grader/procedure` to regenerate the full procedure.

Report clearly what changed and what the professor needs to do next.
